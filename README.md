## SmartPath Google Drive Share

This was an app designed to allow teachers to download lesson plans from the smartpath service. It was connected to the company google drive, and allowed an innovative search function that allowed you to assign labels and categories to google drive files outside of the confines of the vanilla system. Admins could also upload their own lesson plans using either the included extension, or by using the host page on the website.
